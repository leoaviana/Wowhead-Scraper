# Wowhead Scraper

A tool used to gather quest information from wowhead, this is an old project of mine used to make a quest database for my port of a quest translation addon called [QuestTradutor](https://github.com/leoaviana/questtradutor), Since it's a web scraping software, there must be constant updates to the code to be able to get interesting results from wow-head, It was tested to be working in august 2021.

## Notes

1. In it's current state, it will only work for the portuguese version of wowhead, if you wish to gather data from another language, you will need to change some strings in order to get non gibberish data.
2. This is an old project (created from 2017 I believe) made for learning purposes, so you can expect it to be kinda slow and the code isn't documented nor very readable but it's functional for what it was made for.
3. Everything you find except getting quests and generating a .lua file is not tested and probably is not finished and depending on when you're reading this, even getting quest scraping may need to be updated.
